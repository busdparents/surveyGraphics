# What Do Families Want From BUSD?
*A Berkeley Public School Family Survey*


The survey was conducted online for two weeks, via one-time-use survey invitations, from Saturday, February 13, 2021 to Saturday, February 20, 2021. BUSDParents.com invited families in Berkeley public schools (BUSD) via email, through invitations to BUSD parentsâ€™ private email list, BUSD classrooms via email solicitation and through participating elementary PTA email solicitation to BUSD families. The survey was offered in English and Spanish.

808 families responded to the survey, representing 1349 students in the district. BUSD had ~8700 students in fall 2020, with a further reduction of enrollment by a few percentage points in early 2021. BUSD began the 2020/21 school year with an overall 7.5% decline in enrollment, year-on-year from the 2019/2020.
